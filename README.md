## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Yueming](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset?resource=download) for creating and sharing the IMDb 5000 Movie Dataset. Their work has been invaluable in providing the data used for this project.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to showcase and strengthen my skills in Python and SQL through hands-on data analysis and development. I am using this project as a personal challenge and learning opportunity. In the future, I hope to expand it by creating a proper user interface (UI) to make the application more interactive and user-friendly.
